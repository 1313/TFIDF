TFIDF
=====

C# implementation of a TFIDF and VectorSpaceModel calculation for Information retrieval. 

Basically implements different term frequency functions (Logarithmic, Augmented, Boolean etc) together with an IDF function. Might need some performance optimizations/better choice of data structures for larger data sets.

Also a basic Vector Space Model implementation to calculate Cosine similarity between documents or n-dimensional vectors.
